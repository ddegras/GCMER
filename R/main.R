# Main for Graph coloring method for Entity Resolution /Deduplication


## 1. Data preprocessing (clean dataset)
#cora
#affiliation

## 2. Blocking
#generate k blocks

#Dmat (dissimilarity matrix) by jac.sim (start point, initialization)
#Learning metric n rows*m features -> w (metric/weights)


## 3. Dissimilarity matrix
#Generate dissimilarity matrix by w
#Obtain Binary graph

## 4. Graph coloring
# Graph coloring on complement graph from dissimilarity matrix
# with different methods


## 5.Minimum quasi-clique partitioning (competing methods)
# input: graph


## 6. Analysis on the graph coloring results
